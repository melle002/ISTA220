Boxing is used to store value types in the garbage-collected heap. Boxing is an implicit conversion of a value type to the type object or to any interface type implemented by this value type. Unboxing is an explicit conversion from the type object to a value type or from an interface type to a value type that implements the interface.

Cast, in the context of C#, is a method by which a value is converted from one data type to another.
